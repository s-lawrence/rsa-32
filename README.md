# Project Name: RSA-32

## **Description:**

### This is a 32 bit RSA encryption app built with MASM. This application allows for an 80 character string to me encrypted using standard RSA encryption techniques on a smaller scale to allow for no overflow on a 32 bit system. This application also allows decryption of messages with the provided keys upon encryption. 

Main assembly can be found in encryption.asm
